# Simpleview CMS Developer Assessment

part1 - part3 folders contains solution to each of the part, and they are all webpack projects generated by create-react-app. To run the project, simply use `npm install` to install dependencies, and then `npm start` to run the project.

The news folder contains a variation for part3, instead of using [testing API](https://sv-reqres.now.sh/), it uses [News API](https://newsapi.org/). I started using it as a replacement when the test API was not available, but it turns out to be a really useful news page. I'll probably keep extending it to make make it more interesting.
