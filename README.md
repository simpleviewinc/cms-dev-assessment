Update: To Download Submission
======
Git was being funky, all you need is submission.zip and then you can unzip and in each folder individully (except html/css only folder) you will need to ```npm install``` and then ```npm start```. 

Thank you!

Simpleview CMS Developer Assessment
======
Welcome to the Simpleview Developer Assessment.

The assessment is in three (3) parts that increase in complexity and scope. You may use any approach you feel comfortable with to complete each section. The assessment period is two (2) days; at the end of the assessment period turn in any and all work including any incomplete work for review.

Although each part builds off the previous, you are expected to turn in three (3) sets of solutions; one for each part.

Assessments
------
**Part 1 - Static**
Build the comped component using dummy content.

For text content, use Lorem Ipsum.

For image content, use [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)

**Part 2 - REST-API**
Build the component again, but instead of using dummy content, build this out using listings data returned from [our test API](https://sv-reqres.now.sh).

Some listings will have broken images, please use the provided fallback image as needed to ensure an image is always rendered.

**Part 3 - Filtering**
Build the component a final time with data from the API. Include listings, events, and offers data as well as a buttons that will enable a user to see all data, only listings data, only events data, or only offers data.

Some listings/evensts/offers will have broken images, please use the provided fallback image as needed to ensure an image is always rendered.

Submitting Your Assessment For Review
------
When you've completed the assessment, submit your work via a Pull Request to this repo. Your Pull Request should contain three (3) folders that contain your solution; one (1) for each part of the assessment.
